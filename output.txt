NEAR THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER, EINSTEIN THOUGHT THAT NEWTONIAN MECHANICS WAS NO LONGER ENOUGH TO RECONCILE THE LAWS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS WITH THE LAWS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD. THIS LED HIM TO DEVELOP HIS SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY DURING HIS TIME AT THE SWISS ARTICLE THEORY AND THE MOTION OF MOLECULES. HE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE THERMAL PROPERTIES OF LIGHT WHICH LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE PHOTON THEORY OF LIGHT. IN 1917, HE APPLIED THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY TO MODEL THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE.PATENT OFFICE IN BERN (1902â€“1909). HOWEVER, HE REALIZED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY COULD ALSO BE EXTENDED TO GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS, AND HE PUBLISHED A PAPER ON GENERAL RELATIVITY IN 1916 WITH HIS THEORY OF GRAVITATION. HE CONTINUED TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND QUANTUM THEORY, WHICH LED TO HIS EXPLANATIONS OF
